Congratulations! You have found message #1. What you know know is that your batch processing program works. The rest of the messages might be easy to find, but they won't be so easy to decipher. I know you've already written some cipher classes. Here's your first hint. One of the messages is encoded with a substitution cipher such that the ASCII characters 32-126 correspond to the following string: this backwards apostrophe thing is the first character in the string-->`1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./~!@#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:"ZXCVBNM<>? <--this space is the last character in the string. I'm not going to tell you which file is encrypted using a the substitution cipher, so hopefully you've narrowed your list down far enough where you can run your decryption on each file until you find the one with a hidden message. Have fun finding the rest!
