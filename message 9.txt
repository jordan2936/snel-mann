Message 9. Did you read the message about Steganograpy? Pretty interesting, isn't it? Now I'll bet you're wondering where the last message is. One teacher photo on the J.L. Mann website has a PNG file extension rather than JPG. That image has a message hidden inside. You can check the file extensions by right-clicking on each image to open it in a new tab. Download the image and then use the blue_steganography.py program from https://github.com/joncoop/blue_steganography to extract the final message from the picture. And here's another interesting thing about the Vigenere cipher... Because several different shifts are used, the character distribution of encrypted text is much flatter than with a Caesar cipher where all characters are shifted amount. I needed to type quite a bit more text in this message just so the chi-square value would stand out for this ciphered text.
