This is message number 2. Another hidden message is encrypted using a Caesar Cipher. I'm not 

going to tell you the shift or tell you which file it is. However, I will give you a couple 

hints: 1) The file number is prime. 2) The amount of the shift is a value in the Fibonacci 

series. If you still have trouble finding it, then reread the description of the Caesar 

cipher in the project description. I also encoded one file with the Veginere cipher. The 

keyword is the name of a famous mechanical ciphering maching invented by German engineer 

Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. (The keyword is in all lowercase letters.) Use 

teamwork. Let two people find the Caesar and two find the Veginere.
